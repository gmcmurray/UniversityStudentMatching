# UniversityStudentMatching
Solves a matching assignment for N students to M universities where
both have preferences and universities have their own capacities.
All students are assigned and all universities fill their capacities.
Uses a modified Gale-Shapely algorithm with capacities.  Algorithm
favors the students.  Sum of university capacities = N number of
students.

Rogue Couple function has been created and tested to check for rogue
couples.  Algorithm guarantees no rogue couples though.
